What is Maven ?
Build tool
Project Mgt Tool >> Helps in generating reports, DI

Common Problems  : Multiple Jars, Dependencies and Version, Project Structure,  Building , Publishing and Deploying

>>mkdir newdir
>> mvn archetype:generate

Output is : Folder str , pom.xml

move to the folder where we have pom.xml
>>mvn compile
>>mvn package


Maven Build  Phases : 
validate(checks for proper ordering)
compile(generates .class)
test(test cases)
package(package all class files)
install(install artifact/package into local maven repo)
deploy(doen't deploy to server, deploy artifact/package into local maven repo)

If all three phases executes, then package happens.
package phase will first run >> validate >> compile >> test
